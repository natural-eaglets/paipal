## Detailed Process Flow

### 1. User Requests Vault Creation
A user submits a vault creation request via the Paipal interface or smart contract.

They specify:
* Supported assets (e.g. USDC, ETH)
* Risk level (e.g., low, medium, degen)
* Optional filters or constraints

### 2. TEE-Protected AI Deployer Instantiates the Vault
The request is handled by the Deployer Agent, an AI running inside a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).

This agent:
* Verifies the request
* Generates the smart vault contract
* Applies user-defined rules and permissions

Permissions are minimal and trustless:
* Only the user can trigger withdrawals
* Only verified Executor Agents can move funds into strategies (never to arbitrary wallets)
* Cross-chain transfers are permissioned via secure channels (e.g., AggLayer + TEE signatures)

### 3. Ownership Assignment & Vault Registration
Vault ownership is assigned to the user on-chain.

The vault is registered in the Paipal Registry, allowing the AI Strategy Agent to start monitoring.

Metadata (risk score, preferences) is stored off-chain or in encrypted TEE memory.

### 4. AI Strategy Agent Kicks In
The AI Strategy Agent (also inside a TEE) starts:
* Monitoring the vault's balance and market conditions
* Generating allocation strategies based on risk preferences

Once it finds an optimal plan, it:
* Signs the proposed transaction
* Publishes it on-chain or to a secure message bus for Executor Agents

### 5. Executor Nodes Perform the Allocation
Executor Agents (community-run nodes) pick up signed instructions.

They cannot change or interpret logic ‚Äî only execute:
* Transfer funds
* Bridge if needed
* Deploy to strategy (e.g. Aave, GMX, Curve)

Execution is trustless and verifiable:
* Instruction includes AI signature
* Executors are rewarded only if the action matches the AI's signed request

## Trust Model

| Component | Actor Type | TEE-Protected | Role |
|-----------|------------|---------------|------|
| Deployer Agent | AI | ‚úÖ | Secure vault instantiation |
| Strategy Agent | AI | ‚úÖ | Risk analysis + proposal |
| Executor Agent | Human Node | ‚ùå (verifies TEE signature) | Performs allocation |

## Security Considerations
* All parameters are validated before deployment
* Risk levels are strictly enforced
* Asset support is verified against protocol whitelist
* Optional filters undergo security checks

## Technical Implementation
The deployment process uses a secure, multi-step verification system to ensure:
* Parameter validation
* Security checks
* Proper contract initialization
* Correct asset configuration

## Notes
* All deployments are tracked and monitored
* Changes to vault parameters require governance approval
* Risk levels cannot be modified after deployment without formal process

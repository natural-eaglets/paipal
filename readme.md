## 🎯 Introduction

Paipal is a **DeFi AI agent** designed to optimize yield generation on stablecoins while maintaining **full decentralization and security**. Operating within a **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)**, Paipal ensures that all operations are **verifiable, trustless, and transparent**.

Traditional yield-generation solutions for retail users are problematic: decentralized options require complex manual management and expose users to smart contract risks, while centralized exchanges expose users to **counterparty risk, low returns, and fund mismanagement**. Paipal disrupts this model by allowing users to **retain full custody of their assets** while leveraging AI-driven **yield optimization** and **automated risk management**.

## ⚡ Key Features

### 🔒 1. Trustless Yield Optimization
Users can deposit stablecoins directly from their own **abstracted smart wallet** (a personal vault they control), and grant specific permissions to Paipal's AI agent to maximize yield across **multiple DeFi protocols**. Users maintain full ownership of their wallet while the AI agent operates within strictly defined permissions to optimize their yield—no active management needed, with full transparency.

### 🛡️ 2. TEE-Powered Security & Transparency
Paipal operates within a **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)**, ensuring all computations are:
* 🔐 **Tamper-proof** – No external party, not even the Paipal team, can modify execution
* ✅ **Verifiable** – The integrity of transactions can be independently checked by users

### 💼 3. Smart Wallet & Predefined Permissions
Paipal's AI agent interacts with users' **smart wallets (account abstraction)** based on strictly defined permissions. Users remain in full control of their wallet and only **grant specific permissions** to the **Paipal AI agent**, ensuring all operations follow **transparent and auditable conditions** within the approved strategy scope.

### 🤖 4. AI-Powered Risk Management
Paipal employs an AI agent to continuously monitor **market conditions, yield opportunities, and potential risks**.
* 🚨 Automatic protection against TVL drops, depegging events, and APY changes
* 🔄 Smart reallocation to protect user funds

### 🌉 5. Cross-Chain Yield Aggregation
Paipal leverages **AggLayer** (Polygon's cross-chain aggregation layer) for seamless **liquidity movements across blockchains**, eliminating the need for traditional bridges and enabling access to yield opportunities across the entire DeFi ecosystem.

### 🏛️ 6. Community-Governed Strategies
All fund movements and strategy changes require **governance approval**. This ensures that yield optimization remains **aligned with the community's best interests**.
